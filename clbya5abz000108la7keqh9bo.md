# Agile development environment to a 10 year old

Hello there!

Today, I want to talk to you about a way of creating software that is called "agile development." This is a way that software engineers like me work together to build and improve computer programs.

So, what is agile development?

Agile development is a method of creating software that focuses on flexibility and continuous improvement. This means that we don't try to plan out every single detail of the software before we start building it. Instead, we start by building a basic version of the software and then we work on making it better and better over time.

We do this by working in small teams and having regular meetings to talk about what we are working on and what we need to do next. We also have something called "sprints," which are short periods of time (usually a few weeks) where we focus on a specific set of tasks.

One of the main benefits of agile development is that it allows us to respond quickly to changes and to the needs of our users. For example, if we find out that a feature of the software is not working as well as we thought it would, we can quickly change it or add something new to make it better.

Another benefit of agile development is that it helps us stay organized and focused. We use tools like "task boards" to keep track of what we are working on and what needs to be done. This helps us stay on top of our work and make sure that we are making progress.

So, that's a little bit about agile development and how it works. I hope this helps you understand how software engineers like me work together to build and improve computer programs!
