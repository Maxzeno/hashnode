# A Beginner's Guide to CI/CD on AWS

Continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) is a software engineering practice that aims to reduce the time and effort required to develop, test, and deploy code changes. In a CI/CD workflow, developers commit their code changes to a version control system, and then a series of automated processes takes over to build, test, and deploy the code to production.

There are many ways to set up a CI/CD workflow, and the specific steps will depend on your development process, the tools you are using, and the infrastructure you have in place. However, here are some general steps that are commonly followed in a CI/CD workflow:

1.  Commit code changes: Developers make changes to the codebase and commit their changes to a version control system, such as Git.
    
2.  Run automated tests: After code changes are committed, automated tests are run to ensure that the code is working as expected and that there are no regressions.
    
3.  Build the code: If the tests pass, the code is automatically built, usually using a build tool such as Jenkins or Travis CI.
    
4.  Deploy to staging: The built code is then deployed to a staging environment, where it can be tested and validated by QA teams.
    
5.  Release to production: After the code has been tested and validated in the staging environment, it can be released to production. This may involve manually promoting the code from staging to production, or it may be automated using a deployment pipeline.
    

In AWS, you can use a variety of services to set up a CI/CD workflow. For example, you can use AWS CodePipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment process, or you can use AWS CodeBuild to build and test your code. Additionally, you can use AWS CodeCommit as your version control system, or you can use a third-party tool such as GitLab or GitHub.

Overall, a CI/CD workflow helps to streamline the software development process, allowing teams to iterate quickly and deliver code changes more frequently and with fewer errors.
